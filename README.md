This is a project completed through the DataQuest.io learning platform. This project is meant to combine Python fundamentals to inform a business decision. I cleaned, filtered, and analyzed data to find which types of free apps attract the most users.
### Visualizing Long-term Precipitation Data<br />

In this analysis I visualize precipitation data from Watsonville, CA from the years 1908-2013. I plot the whole record as a time series to gain big picture insights. Then, I plot monthly averages to gain insights about the rainy season during the year. I use pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
