# Deandra Alvear's Data Science Portfolio
This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks and is organized by type of analysis performed.

## Clustering
### Battle of the Neighborhoods <br />
[Github](https://gist.github.com/d-alvear/6b023d5d5bf0c458c66f4a26379f99a9) | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/d-alvear/6b023d5d5bf0c458c66f4a26379f99a9) <br />
This is a project I completed through the Data Science Specialization Capstone Courser through Coursera. My goal was to answer, based on neighborhood venue types, whether Manhattan or San Francisco offers more "bang for your buck." I compared rent prices and venues per neighborhood for both cities. I used k-means clustering analysis and leveraged data using the Foursquare API.

## Data Exploration and Analyses
### Exploring Ebay Car Sale Data<br />

[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/d-alvear/portfolio_projects/blob/master/exploring_ebay_car_sale_data.ipynb)<br />
This project uses Pandas and Numpy to explore and clean Ebay car sale data. After cleaning the data I compare mean price and mileage of the top five manufacturers that make up most of the Ebay car listings.
### Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets<br />
[Github](https://github.com/d-alvear/portfolio_projects/blob/master/Project_Profitable%20App%20Profiles%20for%20the%20App%20Store%20and%20Google%20Play%20Markets.ipynb)   | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/d-alvear/portfolio_projects/blob/master/Project_Profitable%20App%20Profiles%20for%20the%20App%20Store%20and%20Google%20Play%20Markets.ipynb)<br />
This is a project completed through the DataQuest.io learning platform. This project is meant to combine Python fundamentals to inform a business decision. I cleaned, filtered, and analyzed data to find which types of free apps attract the most users.
### Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQLite and Python<br />
[Github](https://github.com/d-alvear/portfolio_projects/blob/master/SQL%20factbook%20data.ipynb) | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/d-alvear/portfolio_projects/blob/master/SQL%20factbook%20data.ipynb)<br />
In this project, I work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like population, population growth, and total land and water area. I use the Python SQLite workflow to explore, analyze, and visualize data from this database. I'll use pandas and matplotlib to display my results.
### Cleaning and Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys
[Github](https://github.com/d-alvear/Analyzing-Employee-Exit-Surveys/blob/master/Part%202/V7_analyzing_employee_exit_surveys.ipynb) | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/d-alvear/Analyzing-Employee-Exit-Surveys/blob/master/Part%202/V7_analyzing_employee_exit_surveys.ipynb)<br />
In this project, I take on the role of a data analyst. I work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. I clean and analyze the data to answer the following questions to stakeholders:
* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

### Answering Business Questions Using SQL<br />
[Github](https://github.com/d-alvear/SQL-Business-Analysis-Project/blob/master/V7_sql_business_analysis_project.ipynb) | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/d-alvear/SQL-Business-Analysis-Project/blob/master/V7_sql_business_analysis_project.ipynb)<br />
In this project I answer business questions about trends in record store purchases and country wide album sales. I use SQL to exract relevant data and visualize my findings using matplotlib and pandas.

## Data Visualization
### Visualizing Earnings Based on College Majors<br />
[Github](https://github.com/d-alvear/visualizing_earnings_from_major/blob/master/visualizing_earnings_from_major_FINAL.ipynb) | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/d-alvear/visualizing_earnings_from_major/blob/master/visualizing_earnings_from_major_FINAL.ipynb) <br />
In this project I visualize the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. Using visualizations, I explore questions from the dataset such as:
Do students in more popular majors make more money? How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female? Which category of majors have the most students?
### Visualizing Long-term Precipitation Data<br />
[Github](https://github.com/d-alvear/portfolio_projects/blob/master/visualizing_long_term_precipitation_data.ipynb) | [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/d-alvear/portfolio_projects/blob/master/visualizing_long_term_precipitation_data.ipynb)<br />
In this analysis I visualize precipitation data from Watsonville, CA from the years 1908-2013. I plot the whole record as a time series to gain big picture insights. Then, I plot monthly averages to gain insights about the rainy season during the year. I use pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.
